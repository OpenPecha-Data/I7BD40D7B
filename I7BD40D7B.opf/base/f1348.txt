The Seventh Ground: Far Progressed

Now, in terms of the seventh resolve it was said:On Far Progressed the bodhisattvas can engageCessation in each moment, a
nd they now attainA brilliant perfection in their skilful means. (7.1)To engage cessation refers to entering into the st
ate of the final goal, meaning cessation into ultimate reality where all mental elaboration ceases. The bodhisattvas on 
the seventh ground, Far Progressed, now enter into the cessation they achieved on the sixth ground in each moment. As st
ated:O heirs of the Victor, from the sixth bodhisattva ground onwards they settle within the state of cessation of bodhi
sattvas. In each moment of mind the bodhisattvas established on this seventh bodhisattva ground enter into and emerge fr
om the state of cessation, but this cannot be described as the definitive experience of cessation.1Their perfection of s
kilful means is also utterly purified.It should be taken into consideration that skilful means, aspiration, power and wi
sdom are in fact particular aspects of intelligence (prajñā) itself, and that in the context of the perfection of intell
igence it is solely the intelligence of analytical investigation that is dealt with, and not the others.

This was the seventh resolve from the Commentary to Entering the Middle Way.
